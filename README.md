## Hello, I'm Brielle Foster.

I am a passionate student at the University of Arizona with a focus on developing my skills in programming, creating tools, and maintainiing pipelines. I am excited to apply for the Technical Artist Intern, Tools & Pipeline position at Riot Games, where I hope to learn and contribute to the iconic universe of *League of Legends*.

In this repository, you'll find projects showcasing my skills in scripting which will evolve more after my spring semester at the University of Arizona where I will be taking another course in Python.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, C# (I am taking a course on C# in spring)
- **Tools & Software**: Unity (I am taking a course on C# in spring, Adobe
- **Pipeline**: Debugging
- **Version Control**: Git
